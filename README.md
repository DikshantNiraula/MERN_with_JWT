# MERN_with_JWT
This repository can be used for Authentication purpose in  MERN application.

We can Login or Register and get token using Json Web Token(JWT).
This also uses Redux for state management and uses "auth" as a global state on the store 
so we can use logged in user data any where within our application.

#To use this we can simply
1. git clone "https://github.com/DikshantNiraula/MERN_with_JWT"
2. npm install in root directory
3. cd client and npm install
4. make a default.json folder and add mongoDB credential to connect app to the database.
5. Also add JWTSecret in default.jso folder
6. In root directly run "npm ru dev" it starts both server at port 5000 and frontend at port 3000.

After this it would be good to go....
